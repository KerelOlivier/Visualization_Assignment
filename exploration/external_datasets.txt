For the rental properties in NYC
(Public)
Condo: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Condominium-Comparable-Rental-Income-in-NYC/9ck6-2jew
This dataset is separated into neighbourhoods and seems useful, but it is only until 2018.

census.gov (but only 2017): https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/nychvs/#/?s_tableName=TABLE6&s_byGroup1=3
Or this: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nychvs.html
This is only until 2017, as said before.

nyc.gov (not divided by boroughs so useless): https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/about/research.page
This is not divided into neighbourhoods, so we can't use it

(Private companies)
Zillow: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/
This would be a useful dataset if we were looking at rental prices, but it does not say how many rental properties there are, so it is not useful for our task.

Apartment list: https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/category/data-rent-estimates
This is not divided into neighbourhoods, so not useful.

Streeteasy: https://streeteasy.com/blog/data-dashboard/?agg=Total&metric=Inventory&type=Rentals&bedrooms=Any%20Bedrooms&property=Any%20Property%20Type&minDate=2010-01-01&maxDate=2022-10-01&area=Flatiron,Brooklyn%20Heights
This is a usable dataset for what we want.

Elliman report: https://www.elliman.com/corporate-resources/market-reports
This is not really a dataset (but we could do that manually), and it has only Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.
