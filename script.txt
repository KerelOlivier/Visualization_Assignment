# Main Script
Hello, we are from group 73 with Olivier, Iona, Dayeong, and Sietske. 
We would like to introduce our visualization tool (NAME).

On the top left-hand side of the page, you can see the title
which indicates the neighbourhood or group you are looking at. 
You can see five different plots with titles and 
a dashboard with a drop-down menu and checkboxes. 
You can type in a zipcode, or type neighbourhood or group 
regardless of capital letters and click on it, 
and the title and plots will be updated accordingly. 
The other checkboxes will be explained further while exploring the plots.
 
Now, we will explore the five different plots with different tasks.
First, we enter 11105 in the zipcode field, 
check the noise complaints in the dashboard, 
and look at this plot. 
Some people might think that Airbnbs cause many noises, 
but we can see that the majority of them are located in relatively quiet areas 
by looking at the density. 
Hovering over each point shows the airbnbs' name.
 
Next, we click on the enabled colourblind mode, 
scroll or type in Battery Park City. 
When we hover over, we can see that about 70 local hosts own Airbnbs on this plot. 
We click on the far left bar, and the graph below shows which hosts own how many Airbnbs. 
We can observe that one host owns a lot of Airbnbs, 
including in other neighbourhoods.
 
We disable the colourblind mode, enter Central Park, 
and then we can see one dot highlighted as green. 
Hovering over it shows the numbers of Airbnbs and Hotels. 
We can also see the white regression line, 
so we can observe that there are more Airbnbs for all neighbourhoods. 
If we enter Bronx, then it shows the relations with other neighbourhood groups.
 
We enable the colourblind mode again, enter Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
and check the Fire alarm or CO monitor. 
Hovering over each dot shows the exact coordinates of each Airbnb. 
And we can observe that there are only a few that don't have safety measures.
 
Lastly, we disable the colourblind mode and enter Hunts Point. 
This neighbourhood has a relatively high crime rate in New York. 
We can see some positive words 'travelerdream, affordable' and 'prolonged' (is it negative?).
We also enter Mott Haven and can see many positive words 
like 'lovely, charming, cozy' with different sizes of fonts and colours reflected by power law.
 
Thank you for watching, and don't forget to give us 110 points.
